How Does Authentication work
============================
=> we can't jst save and use the "yes" after loggin in.
=> we could send a fake "yes" to the server to request protected data

There are two main solutions 

1.server side sessions
	After a user was logged in and authenticated we store a unique identifier
	on the server.we basically stored a yes on the server and mapped that to a 
	specific client with help of an id thats then sent back to the client.and the
	client then sends that ID with future requests which do try to access protected resources.
	And since we stored a yes mapped to that id on the server,the server
	is able to check whether that client really does have permission to access protected resources.
	but it requires tighly coupled b/w backend and frontend.
	bcse backend must store info about the client.
2.authentication tokens.
	The idea behind authentication tokens is that on the server after a user was authenticated,
	so after a user sent a valid pair of credentials,for example,we create but dont store a permission
	token on the backend and we send that token back to the client.
	The special about this token is that its validity can only be checked & proven by the backend
	that created that token.bcse the token is created with help of some private key which is only known by the
	backend.so in future requests from the client to the backend we attach that token to those
	requests,and the backend is able to take a look at that token,validated and see if it is a token that was created
	by that backend.and if it is a valid token,then permission to those protected resources
	is granted.



Project SetUp & Route Setup
============================

App.js
------
{
 	path:'auth',
      element:<AuthenticationPage/>
 }


MainNavigation.js
-----------------
<li>
    <NavLink
     to="/auth"
     className={({ isActive }) =>
     isActive ? classes.active : undefined
     }
     >
     Authentication
     </NavLink>
</li>
